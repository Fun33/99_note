Hello there,  Happy New Year!
Thank you for your mail. 

I am on business trip till 06 Feb 2013, having limited email access. In cases of SDK/B1i/HANA inquiry, you can contact my manager Bagnoli, Gianluigi (gianluigi.bagnoli@sap.com).  He will help you connect someone else in the team.  

Kind regards, Yatsea
